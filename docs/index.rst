Welcome to FoundationDesign's documentation!
============================================

``FoundationDesign`` FoundationDesign is a python module to be used for the design and analysis
of different foundation types in accordance to the Eurocode 2.

   - The critical bending moments in the foundation
   - Critical shear force in the foundation
   - Transverse shear check of the foundation
   - Sliding checks
   - Crack width checks
   - Reinforcement provisions
   - Punching shear checks etc
