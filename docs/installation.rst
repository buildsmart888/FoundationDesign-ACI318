* The easiest way to try this package for now is using a web-based notebook:
* Here's an example featuring the design of a concentric pad foundation

* You can also download and install the ``FoundationDesign`` package, which runs on Python 3.

  * If you do not have a Python 3 interpreter on your machine, you can install the last version following the instructions in `this tutorial <https://realpython.com/installing-python/>`_.
  * Once you have Python 3, you can open a terminal and install the package with this one-liner::

      python3 -m pip install --user FoundationDesign

    **NOTE**: You may need to replace ``python3`` above by the path to your Python 3 executable, or simply ``python`` if you are running Windows.

This project is open source, and the code can be found in this `GitHub repository
